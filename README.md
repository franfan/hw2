I created two different Mondrian's canvases.
And I changed the ball to move upside and downside instead of moving left and right side.
I also tried to create three balls togther, but I don't know what's going on this coding....
For the final assignment, I changed the mode to RGB with different colors, and also changed the area of the circles can move and exist in this coding.
I changed the x, y to cats and dogs, it shows enclose, rather than being right coding. And the system doesn't let this keep going anymore.
